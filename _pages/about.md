I'm currently a master's student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. I'm also a research assistant in the Center for Systems Biology (CSB) at Massachusetts General Hospital. At CSB I'm part of the [Biomedical Engineering Group](https://csb.mgh.harvard.edu/engineering/people) which is working towards a revolutionary holographic imaging technology that will address a significant clinical need in lymphoma diagnosis across resource-limited settings:

This low-cost system is called the Digital Diffraction Diagnostic (D3). It provides a fast, on-site count of malignant lymphoma cells and can stratify high and low-grade lymphomas. It is scheduled for a prospective clinical trial in Botswana in 2018.  If successful, the clinical trial will yield a point-of-care platform that has the potential to improve significantly clinical outcomes for lymphoma patients across rural sub-Saharan Africa. 

Prior to MIT, I was a co-founder of [SnapJet](http://www.snapjet.com), an ultra-high resolution portable printer for smartphones. At SnapJet, I led a team that designed, patented, and raised over $210,000 in crowd-funding on Kickstarter. I've also also served as a technology vendor to Cornell University and the US Centers for Disease Control, delivering analysis tools that have played a key role in behavioral studies of HIV victims in 25 US cities. I have a BS in Computer Science from Cornell University’s Engineering School,
